# payverse-solana
PayVerse is a Solana-based payment platform that lets anyone receive stablecoin payments using a single username instead of managing multiple wallet addresses. It automatically detects the sender’s network, verifies tokens, and routes payments into Solana USDC securely, simplifying global payments for freelancers, merchants, and creators.
